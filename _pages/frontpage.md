## Welcome to My Blog

Hello, and welcome to my blog! This space is dedicated to documenting my personal technical learning journey in the realms of CI/CD, Kubernetes, Ansible, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Here, I will share my experiences and insights as I explore these technologies, focusing on both my homelab setup and personal cloud accounts.

### Background

I started my career in a traditional Linux role, where I gained a solid foundation in system administration and scripting. Over time, I transitioned into the DevOps space, where I embraced automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery practices. This journey led me to explore various tools and technologies, including:

- **CI/CD**: Implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrating containerized applications for scalability, reliability, and efficient resource management.
- **Ansible**: Automating configuration management and application deployment with simple, powerful, and agentless automation.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

### What to Expect

In this blog, you can expect to find:

- **Tutorials and How-Tos**: Step-by-step guides on setting up and using various tools and technologies.
- **Project Updates**: Insights and updates on my ongoing projects, including my homelab and cloud setups.
- **Lessons Learned**: Reflections on the challenges and successes I encounter along the way.
- **Best Practices**: Tips and best practices for working with CI/CD, Kubernetes, Ansible, and IaC.

Join me as I navigate through the challenges and triumphs of this exciting journey. I hope my experiences can provide valuable insights and inspiration for others on a similar path.

Stay tuned for more posts and updates!
