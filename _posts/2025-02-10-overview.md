# Embarking on a Home Lab Automation Adventure: An Overview

Welcome to my journey of transforming a humble home lab into a well-oiled machine powered by automation! In this introductory overview, I'll give you a glimpse into the tools and strategies I use. Stay tuned for detailed deep-dives into each topic in future posts.

## The Mission

My goal is simple yet ambitious: create an automated environment where devices and services operate seamlessly. By leveraging powerful tools like Ansible and Kubernetes, I ensure everything runs smoothly with minimal manual intervention, keeping my lab always up-to-date.

## Tools of the Trade: A Sneak Peek

### **Ansible: The Backbone**

Ansible is at the heart of my setup, providing configuration management that simplifies task execution across multiple devices:

- **Roles & Playbooks**: I use tailored scripts and playbooks to manage configurations efficiently. Here’s a taste:
  - *Common Roles*: Shared settings for all devices.
  - *Monitoring Tools*: Essential tools like node-exporter and promtail keep everything in check.

### **Kubernetes: Orchestrating the Future**

Kubernetes orchestrates application deployment, ensuring scalability and reliability:

- **Structure**: I manage applications with manifests that cover specific needs:
  - *Apps & Base Configurations*: From Argo CD to Prometheus.
  - *Ingress Management*: Efficiently handling external traffic.

### **Continuous Integration & Testing**

With GitHub Actions, my CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality and robust testing:

- **Self-hosted Runners**: Mimicking production environments for reliable tests.

## Monitoring: The Watchful Eye

Monitoring is crucial to maintaining system health. Tools like Grafana and InfluxDB provide valuable insights into performance metrics across the lab environment.

## Branching Strategy & Release Process: Keeping Order

To manage changes effectively, I follow a monthly branching strategy:

- **Monthly Branches**: Develop features or updates in dedicated branches.
- **Merging/Rebasing**: Regularly update these branches to maintain stability.
- **Main Branch**: Always stable and deployable, updated only with thoroughly tested changes.

The release process involves rigorous testing and deployment, ensuring each release is reliable.

## The Road Ahead

Future posts will delve deeper into Ansible roles, Kubernetes configurations, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring setups, and more. Each topic deserves its own spotlight to explore the intricacies involved in building a robust home lab environment.
