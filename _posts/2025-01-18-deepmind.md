So, I was trying to set up this a linter + PR flow for my homelab Ansible repo, and BAM! I hit this error:
``` [remote rejected] lint-fixes -> lint-fixes (refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow .github/workflows/badge.yml without workflows permission)```
I was wrestling with this error to try to get any linter to generate auto-PRs (specifically prettier) when I came across deepmind. I took a look and it seems like it was made for exactly this - lint, scan, access and offer up a PR!
Easy peasy, right?
## Deepmind: My Ansible's New Best Friend
Now that Deepmind has the right permissions, let me tell you why I'm loving this tool. It's like having a super-powered linter that dives deep into my Ansible code, finding not just syntax errors but also potential security issues and those annoying inconsistencies that drive me crazy.
But the best part? **Autofix!** Deepmind actually fixes many of the problems it finds and creates a pull request with the changes. No more wasting time on minor fixes â€“ Deepmind takes care of it.  
## Deepmind in My Homelab
I've been using Deepmind to scan my Ansible roles, and it's been a game-changer. It recently found a security vulnerability in one of my roles that I had completely missed.  It also helps me keep my YAML files clean and consistent, which is a big deal for me.
