## From Docker Run to GitOps: My Homelab Journey (Part 1)

Hey everyone! I'm excited to start this little series about my journey into GitOps, specifically in the context of my homelab. Like many, I started tinkering with Docker and quickly fell in love with the ability to spin up services with a single command. I was living in the command line, `docker run`ing everything. It was great... at first.

But as my homelab grew, that command line history started to look like a chaotic mess. Trying to remember all the flags, ports, and volumes I’d mapped for each container became a real headache. That’s when I discovered the magic of `docker-compose`.

Suddenly, I could define my entire application stack in a neat little YAML file. No more endless command lines! I could spin up multiple containers with a single `docker-compose up` command. Life was good. But there was still one problem: these `docker-compose.yml` files were just sitting on my hard drive. If my machine crashed, or I wanted to replicate my setup elsewhere, I was in trouble.

That's where Git came in. I'd heard about it, of course, but hadn't really used it seriously. It seemed intimidating at first, but honestly, getting started was much easier than I thought. I created a simple Git repository and started committing my `docker-compose.yml` files. Game changer!

Now, I had version control for my infrastructure. I could track changes, revert to previous versions if something broke, and even collaborate with myself (ha!). It felt like a huge step forward. It wasn't quite full-blown GitOps yet, but it was the crucial first step.

In this post, I want to share my simple workflow for using Git to manage my Docker Compose configurations. It’s perfect for anyone who’s moved past `docker run` and is looking for a more organized approach. We'll cover:

* Setting up a basic Git repository (it's easier than you think!)
* Adding your `docker-compose.yml` files to the repo
* Basic Git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push`
* A simple workflow for making changes and deploying them

This is just the beginning of my GitOps journey. Eventually, I want to explore more advanced concepts like CI/CD, automated deployments, and maybe even Kubernetes. But for now, mastering the basics of using Git with Docker Compose has been a huge win. Stay tuned for the next post where I’ll dive into the specifics of setting up your first Git repo for your Docker Compose files!
